## Introduction 

I am currently taking an introductory class in abstract algebra, and we have been learning about different types of groups. One of these groups is called the **Symmetric Group**. The symmetric group defined over any set , $$\Omega$$, is denoted as $$S_{\Omega}$$. This group is comprised of all of the bijections $$\sigma_{n} : \Omega \rightarrow \Omega$$ of the set onto itself, and its group operation is defined as the composition of these bijections.
