Binet's Formula: $$F_{n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \left(\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) ^{n} -  \left(\frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{n}\right)$$

where $$F_{n}$$ is the $$n^{th}$$ Fibonacci number

Typically, Binet's formula over $$\mathbb{N}$$ gives us $$F_{1} = 1, F_{2} = 1, F_{3} = 2$$ ..., but what happens when we use Binet's formula to find the "$$0.5^{th}$$ Fibonacci number" or the "$$\pi^{th}$$ Fibonacci number"?
