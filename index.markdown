title: About Me
---

I am a senior Pure Math major with minors in Computer Science and Physics at Florida State University.

My main interests in math and computer science are theoretical computer science, algorithms, and machine learning theory. I am currently an intern at NewSci, LLC where I work on computer vision and machine learning projects. This summer, I will be a Software Engineering intern at Intuit.

I am also working on an undergraduate honor's thesis project under the guidance of [Alec Kercheval](https://www.math.fsu.edu/~kercheva/) and [Nathan Crock](https://www.sc.fsu.edu/people?uid=ndc08). The topic of the project is the "double descent" phenomenon. By the end of Summer 2020, we will have a precise question that we will try to answer by the end of Spring 2021. This website will act as somewhat of a captain's log where I will share what I am working on and other things that interest me along the way.
